# Vowel-and-Consonant-Classification-through-Spectral-Decomposition
Given an undeciphered alphabetic writing system or mono-alphabetic cipher, we can determine: 
(1) which of its letters are vowels and which are consonants; and 
(2) whether the writing system is a vocalic alphabet or an abjad.

To run the code on the current text samples:
```
python3 main.py
```

To run the code on your own text samples, modify line 60 of main.py.
languages = [('/path/to/text/sample.txt','Language Name', [list of all of this language's letters], [list of all of this language's vowels],[list of all of this language's consonants]), ...]
